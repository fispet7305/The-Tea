<h2>OMG!!!</h2>
<p>Have you heard Ariana Grande's newly released single <em>&quot;Thank you, next&quot;</em>? In it she throws a little shade to her</p>
<p>ex, Pete Davidson, to whom she was engaged. She says &quot; Even almost got married, and for Pete I'm so thankful.&quot;  </p>
<p>After rumors and tweets, the air has been cleared. A source close to Ariana Grande has reported that &quot;it was way</p>
<p>too much too soon&quot;. Another source says that it just wasn't the right time. After her ex Mac Miller's death, Ariana </p>
<p>Grande has been tweeting very sad things and to me, a relationship is not the best thing for her to do. Especially </p>
<p>since it <em>was</em> a rebound relationship...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In happier news, Arianators are anticipating a new song that has yet to be released called<em> &quot;Needy&quot;</em>. She has been</p>
<p>posting snippets of the song and fans are just waiting for it to realease. </p>
